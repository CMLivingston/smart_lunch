A simulation of a typical lunch hour at Dartmouth, with and without the Internet of Things. The ���dumb��� simulation assumes that students have no information about how long lines are at their favorite food venues, whereas the ���smart��� simulation assumes that students have perfect information, and will head to their second-favorite venue if the line is too long at their favorite.
